Installation & Running
----------------------

Copy the `luagdb.txt` file somewhere - installation complete.

To include the macros into your GDB session, run the following command:

    source <path to luagdb.txt>

Use now `luatrace [L-state]` to print a traceback of the Lua stack (default variable `L`).
